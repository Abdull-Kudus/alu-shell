# ALU Shell Project: Loops, Conditions and Parsing
This project contains a series of Bash scripts that use loops (`for`, `while`, `until`), conditionals (`if`, `elif`, `else`, `case`) and file operations. It also involves parsing and processing text-based data from log files.


1-for_best_school: This script prints the phrase "Best School" 10 times using a for loop.


2-while_best_school: This script prints the phrase "Best School" 10 times using a while loop.


3-until_best_school: This script prints the phrase "Best School" 10 times using an until loop.


4-if_9_say_hi: This script prints "Best School" for 9 iterations and prints "Hi" after the 9th iteration.


5-4_bad_luck_8_is_your_chance: This script outputs "bad luck" at iteration 4, "good luck" at iteration 8, and "Best School" for all others.


6-superstitious_numbers: This script displays cultural superstitions for the numbers 4, 9, and 17.


7-clock: This script simulates a clock from 0:00 to 12:59.


8-for_ls: This script lists all non-hidden files and removes the part of their names before the first dash (-).


9-to_file_or_not_to_file: This script checks for the existence of a file named "school", printing messages based on whether it's a regular file, empty, or not.


10-fizzbuzz: This script prints numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz", multiples of 5 with "Buzz", and multiples of both with "FizzBuzz".


11-read_and_cut: This script reads the /etc/passwd file and extracts the username, user ID, and home directory for each user.


12-tell_the_story_of_passwd: This script tells a story about each user in the /etc/passwd file, providing details like username, group ID, home directory, shell, and more.


13-lets_parse_apache_logs: This script parses Apache logs to extract the visitor's IP address and HTTP status code from the apache-access.log file.


14-dig_the_data: This script extracts the visitor's IP and HTTP status code, counts occurrences, and sorts the data by frequency.
